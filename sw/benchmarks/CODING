Coding guidelines for the parallel real-time benchmarks
=======================================================


Workload specification
----------------------

  * The workload of a benchmark can be specified in two different ways:
    Either by compiler macros (DEFAULT_*) or by command line arguments.

  * If no command line options are given, the default values from the
    compiler macros DEFAULT_* are used.

  * The command line options are a fixed number of values that start with
    the number of threads, followed by the problem size and optional
    parameters to modify the standard values. Example:

Examples:

    ./ocean 4 6

runs ocean with 4 threads and a problem size of 6.

    ./ocean

runs ocean with the standard configuration DEFAULT_LOG2_P=4 and
DEFAULT_LOG2_N=5, which is the same as ./ocean 16 5.





Coding for OTAWA
----------------

  * Standard functions from clib are not allowed.
    Avoid them (e.g. fabs() or pow(x, 2.0) or use functions from harness.h
    instead.

  * Don't use do {} while () loops.
    Use while () {} instead.
